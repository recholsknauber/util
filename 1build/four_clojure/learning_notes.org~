** Learn Clojure Notes
*** nil is NULL
*** Symbols that start with a leading colon " : " are keywords
*** 4 collection types with literal syntax
**** '(1 2 3) list
**** [1 2 3] vector
**** #{1 2 3} set
**** {:a 1, :b 2} map
*** Java Evaluation is Source Code (characters) --> Compiler (to bytecode) --> JVM --> Effect!
*** Clojure Evaluation is Source Code (characters) --> Reader (to data structures) --> Compiler (to bytecode) --> JVM --> Effect!
*** REPL = Read-Eval-Print-Loop
**** Reads an expression to produce Clojure data.
**** Evaluate the date to yield a result.
**** Print the result by converting from data back to characters.
**** Loop back to the beginning.

*** In the REPL, "*1" signifies the last result, "*2" the result 2 expressions ago, etc.
*** The doc function displays documentation (and returns nil as the result)
**** (doc +) will display the documentation for +
*** find-doc returns a search that includes the docstrings of functions themselves
*** source to see the underlying source
*** def is used to save a piece of data for later
**** (def x 88) sets the symbol "x" to 88
*** println prints with newline, print without
